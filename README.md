# Smart POS Library

This repository contains common libraries for the POS system.

## GitHub Actions Workflow

This project uses GitHub Actions to automatically:

1. Increment the version number
2. Build the project
3. Deploy to GitHub Packages

### How it works

When you push changes to the `main` branch, the following happens automatically:

1. The GitHub Actions workflow is triggered
2. The patch version in `pom.xml` is incremented (e.g., 0.0.1 â†’ 0.0.2)
3. The updated version is committed back to the repository
4. The project is built with Maven
5. The built package is published to GitHub Packages

### Using the library in other projects

To use this library in another project, add the following to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>lk.udcreations</groupId>
        <artifactId>smart-pos-library</artifactId>
        <version>0.0.1</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->
    </dependency>
</dependencies>

<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>github</id>
        <name>GitHub UDCreations Apache Maven Packages</name>
        <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/u-senanayake/smart-pos-library</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

You'll also need to authenticate with GitHub Packages. Create or update your `~/.m2/settings.xml` file:

```xml
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>github</id>
      <username>YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME</username>
      <password>YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN` with a GitHub Personal Access Token that has the `read:packages` scope.
